# Data-Struture-Linked-List-Project-C

In this project is an application to Linked Lists, in which we will implement a large integer calculator. 

Performing arithmetic on very large numbers 
(i.e., numbers with a large number of digits) is an inherit problem in computers as float point representations 
are subject to overflow. Here, we will build an application that should be able to perform arithmetic on very large integers using linked lists.

Your program should perform:
1)addition
2)subtraction
3)multiplication
4)division on arbitrarily large integers. 

   
Each integer is represented as a list of its digits.

For some of the operations, moving backward through the list is useful; 
hence double linked lists are more appropriate to use than normal linked lists.

Implement the multiplication as a standard multiplication where the first
multiplicand is multiplied with each digit of the second multiplicand and then added.

As for division, you have to implement it as a long division. 

You might need to implement additional function to determine if the dividend is larger than the divisor in absolute value.

Your program should read a file containing at least two numbers to perform the operations above.

The user should be able to select the operations (s)he wants to perform through a proper 
menu with the options necessary to run the functionalities of the program 
(i.e., read the input file, add, subtract, multiply, divide, print the results to an output file, and exit).
